#### What next?

* We will create a new plot layout to match the exact turnout. Once we announce it, you will see how much space you have.
* We will identify "signing" keys for each address in `snap.csv`. For example, people using the voting proxy will use their voting key.
* We will provide a page with instructions for providing your art
